# Click-Game
The Click Game is a memory game built with React.js. The game was made functional by dividing up the UI into components, managing states, and responding to user events. This application was created using "Create React App" (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The game is deployed @ https://turanketene.github.io/Click-Game
